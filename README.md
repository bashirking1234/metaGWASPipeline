# metaGWASPipeline

This study is an in silico follow-up analysis to understand the biological relevance of genetic variants and to gain insight into the role of these genetic variants in gene regulation and disease progression. This is realized by means of different modules in a pipeline:

1. eQTL lookup: Investigate the influence of genetic variants on gene expression in relevant tissues.
2. Colocalization analysis: Determine whether GWAS signals and eQTL signals share a common causal variant.
3. TWAS (Transcriptome-Wide Association Study): to impute gene expression in our own cohorts and then perform association analysis of this gene expression with NMIBC recurrence and progression.
